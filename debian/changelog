aladin (7.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Initial release. (Closes: #100011)
  * Repacked source archive "AladinSrc.jar" into a compressed tarball
    after changing the directory tree from 'src/path/to/file' to
    'aladin-7.0/src/path/to/file'
  * Stripped all third-party JARs from the source package.
  * Modified "build.xml" file:
     added several Debian packages under /usr/share/java/ to the
     classpath to replace the imports of third-party libraries which
     came in JAR archives with the sources;
     added some useful properties;
     improved the build directory infrastructure (creation and
     deletion of build dirs);
     added target 'javadoc' which creates the API documentation of the
     package.
